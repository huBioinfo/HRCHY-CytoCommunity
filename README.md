Diverse cell types within a tissue assemble into multicellular structures to shape the functions of the tissue. These structural modules typically comprise specialized consist of subunits, each performing unique roles. Uncovering these hierarchical multicellular structures holds significant importance for gaining deep insights into the assembly principles from individual cells to the entire tissue. However, the methods available for identifying **hierarchical tissue structures** are **quite limited** and have **several limitations** as below.

(1) Using gene expression features as input, requiring a large number of features, which may not be applicable to single-cell spatial omics data.

(2) The identified hierarchical tissue structures may not cover all cells in the dataset.

(3) There may not be a strictly nested relationship between different levels of structures.

(4) Cannot correctly identify tissue structures that are spatially discretely distributed.
